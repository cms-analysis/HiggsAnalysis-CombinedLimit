# Physics Models for SM Higgs Boson Couplings

This page lists the physics models that can be used to perform measurements of the Higgs Boson couplings in the Standard Model (SM). These models follow the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group [LHCHXSWG YR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1347) and have been used in the combination of the [ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02266).

## LHC HCG Models

The following models are used in the LHC Higgs Combination Group (LHC HCG) to perform measurements of the Higgs boson couplings. They are well defined only for a SM Higgs boson mass of a few GeV around the measured value $m_H \approx 125$ GeV. The models are implemented in the python file  [`LHCHCGModels.py`](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/blob/main/python/LHCHCGModels.py).

You can produce the model by including the  following option in the `text2workspace.py` command:

```sh
-P HiggsAnalysis.CombinedLimit.LHCHCGModels:model

```

The next models are constrained models to study a limited set of ratios of couplings. These are particularly useful to study models such as 2HDM that modify the SM Higgs couplings in a specific way. The models are implemented in the python file  [`HiggsCouplings.py`](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/blob/main/python/HiggsCouplings.py).

You can produce the model by including the  following option in the `text2workspace.py` command:

```sh
-P HiggsAnalysis.CombinedLimit.HiggsCouplings:model
