# Introduction

These pages document the
[RooStats](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/RooStats/WebHome) /
[RooFit](https://root.cern.ch/roofit) - based software tools used for
statistical analysis within the [Higgs PAG](HiggsWG) - **combine**.

Combine provides a command line interface to many different statistical techniques available inside RooFit/RooStats used widely inside CMS.

The package exists in GIT under [https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit)

For more information about GIT and its usage in CMS, see [http://cms-sw.github.io/cmssw/faq.html](http://cms-sw.github.io/cmssw/faq.html)

The code can be checked out from GIT and compiled on top of a CMSSW release that includes a recent RooFit/RooStats

# Installation instructions

Installation instructions and recommended versions can be found below. 
Since v9.0.0, the versioning follows the [semantic versioning 2.0.0 standard](https://semver.org/).
Earlier versions are not guaranteed to follow the standard.

## Within CMSSW (recommended for CMS users)

The instructions below are for installation within a CMSSW environment. For end
users that don't need to commit or do any development, the following recipes
should be sufficient. To choose a release version, you can find the latest
releases on github under
[https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/releases](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/releases)

### Combine v9 - recommended version

The nominal installation method is inside CMSSW. The current release targets
CMSSW `11_3_X` series because this release has both python2 and python3 ROOT
bindings, allowing a more gradual migration of user code to python3. Combine is
fully python3-compatible and can work also in 12_X releases.

```sh
cmsrel CMSSW_11_3_4
cd CMSSW_11_3_4/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
cd HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
```
Update to a recommended tag - currently the recommended tag is **v9.1.0**: [see release notes](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/releases/tag/v9.1.0)

```sh
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
git fetch origin
git checkout v9.1.0
scramv1 b clean; scramv1 b # always make a clean build
```

### Combine v8: `CMSSW_10_2_X` release series

Setting up the environment (once):

```sh
export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700
cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_13
cd CMSSW_10_2_13/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
cd HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
```
Update to a recommended tag - currently the recommended tag is **v8.2.0**: [see release notes](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/releases/tag/v8.2.0)

```sh
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
git fetch origin
git checkout v8.2.0
scramv1 b clean; scramv1 b # always make a clean build
```

### SLC6/CC7 release `CMSSW_8_1_X`

Setting up the environment (once):

```sh
# For CC7:
export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc530
# For SLC6:
export SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc530

cmsrel CMSSW_8_1_0
cd CMSSW_8_1_0/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
cd HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
```
Update to a recommended tag - currently the recommended tag for CMSSW_8_1_X is **v7.0.13**:

```sh
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
git fetch origin
git checkout v7.0.13
scramv1 b clean; scramv1 b # always make a clean build
```

## Standalone compilation

The standalone version can be easily compiled using
[cvmfs](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/) as it relies on dependencies which are
already installed at `/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/`. Access to `/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/` can
be obtained from lxplus machines or via `CernVM`. See [CernVM](CernVM.md) for
further details on the latter. In case you do not want to use the `cvmfs`
area, you will need to adapt the location of the dependencies listed in both
the `Makefile` and `env_standalone.sh` files.

```
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
cd HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit/ 
# git checkout <some release>
. env_standalone.sh
make -j 4
```

You will need to source `env_standalone.sh` each time you want to use the package, or add it to your login.

### Standalone compilation with LCG
For compilation outside of CMSSW, for example to use ROOT versions not yet available in CMSSW, one can compile against LCG releases. The current default is to compile with LCG_102 which contains ROOT 6.26:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
cd HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
source env_lcg.sh 
make LCG=1 -j 8
```
To change the LCG version, edit `env_lcg.sh`. The resulting binaries can be relocated (e.g. for use in a
batch job) if the following files are included in the job tarball:
```sh
tar -zcf Combine_LCG_env.tar.gz build interface src/classes.h --exclude=obj
```

### Standalone compilation with `conda`
This recipe will work both for linux and MacOS
```
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
cd HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit

conda install --name base mamba # faster conda
mamba env create -f conda_env.yml

conda activate combine
source set_conda_env_vars.sh
# Need to reactivate
conda deactivate
conda activate combine

make CONDA=1 -j 8
```

Using combine from then on should only require sourcing the conda environment 
```
conda activate combine
```

**Note:** on OS X, `combine` can only accept workspaces, so run `text2workspace.py` first.
This is due to some ridiculous issue with child processes and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (see note in Makefile)

# What has changed between tags? 

You can generate a diff of any two tags (eg for `v7.0.8` and `v7.0.6`) by using following the url:

[https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/compare/v7.0.6...v7.0.7](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/compare/v7.0.6...v7.0.7)

Replace the tag names in the url to any tags you which to compare.

# For developers

We use the _Fork and Pull_ model for development: each user creates a copy of the repository on github, commits their requests there and then sends pull requests for the administrators to merge.

_Prerequisites_

1. Register on github, as needed anyway for CMSSW development: [http://cms-sw.github.io/cmssw/faq.html](http://cms-sw.github.io/cmssw/faq.html)

2. Register your SSH key on github: [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) 1 Fork the repository to create your copy of it: [https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/fork](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/fork) (more documentation at [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) )

You will now be able to browse your fork of the repository from [https://github.com/your-github-user-name/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit](https://github.com/your-github-user-name/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit)

We strongly encourage you to contribute any developments you make back into the main repository. 
See [contributing.md](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/blob/main/contributing.md) for details about contributing. 

# Combine Tool

An additional tool for submitting combine jobs to batch/crab, developed originally for HiggsToTauTau. Since the repository contains a certain amount of analysis-specific code, the following scripts can be used to clone it with a sparse checkout for just the core [`CombineHarvester/CombineTools`](https://github.com/cms-analysis/CombineHarvester/blob/master/CombineTools/) subpackage, speeding up the checkout and compile times:

git clone via ssh:

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-analysis/CombineHarvester/main/CombineTools/scripts/sparse-checkout-ssh.sh)
```

git clone via https:

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-analysis/CombineHarvester/main/CombineTools/scripts/sparse-checkout-https.sh)
```

make sure to run `scram`  to compile the `CombineTools` package.

See the [`CombineHarvester`](http://cms-analysis.github.io/CombineHarvester/) documentation pages for more details on using this tool and additional features available in the full package.
