# Unfolding & regularization

This section details how to perform an unfolded cross-section measurement, *including regularization*, inside Combine. 

There are many resources available that describe unfolding, including when to use it (or not), and what are the usual issues around it. A useful summary is available at the [CMS Statistics Committee pages](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/ScrecUnfolding) on unfolding. You can also 
find a nice overview of unfolding and its usage in combine in [these slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/399923/contributions/956409/attachments/800899/1097609/2015_06_24_LHCXSWG.pdf#search=Marini%20AND%20StartDate%3E%3D2015-06-24%20AND%20EndDate%3C%3D2015-06-24).

The basic idea behind the unfolding technique to describe smearing introduced through the reconstruction (eg of the particle energy) in a given truth level bin $x_{i}$ through a linear relationship to the effects in the nearby truth-bins. We can make statements about the probability $p_{j}$ that the event falling in the truth bin $x_{i}$ is reconstructed in the bin $y_{i}$ via the linear relationship,

$$
y_{obs} = \tilde{\boldsymbol{R}}\cdot x_{true} + b
$$

or, if the truth bins are expressed relative to some particular model, we use the usual *signal strength* terminology, 

$$
y_{obs} = \boldsymbol{R}\cdot \mu + b
$$

Unfolding aims to find the distribution at truth level $x$, given the observations $y$ at reco-level.


## Likelihood-based unfolding

Since Combine has access to the full likelihood for any analysis written in the usual datacard format, we will use likelihood-based unfolding 
throughout - for other approaches, there are many other tools available (eg `RooUnfold` or `TUnfold`), which can be used instead. 

The benefits of the likelihood-based approach are that, 

* Background subtraction is accounted for directly in the likelihood
* Systematic uncertainties are accounted for directly during the unfolding as nuisance parameters
* We can profile the nuisance parameters during the unfolding to make the most of the data available 

In practice, one must construct the *response matrix* and unroll it in the reconstructed bins:

* First, one derives the truth  distribution, eg after the generator-cut only, $x_{i}$.
* Each reconstructed bin (eg each datacard) should describe the contribution from each truth bin - this is how combine knows about $\boldsymbol{R}$ 
and folds in the acceptance/efficiency effects as usual.
* The out-of-acceptance contributions can also be included in the above.

The model we use for this is then just the usual [`PhysicsModel:multiSignalModel`](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/blob/102x/python/PhysicsModel.py#L98), where each *signal* refers to a particular truth level bin. The results can be extracted through a 
simple maximum likelihood fit with, 

```
    text2workspace.py -m 125 --X-allow-no-background -o datacard.root datacard.txt
       -P HiggsAnalysis.CombinedLimit.PhysicsModel:multiSignalModel --PO map='.*GenBin0.*:r_Bin0[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*GenBin1.*:r_Bin1[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*GenBin2.*:r_Bin2[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*GenBin3.*:r_Bin3[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*GenBin4.*:r_Bin4[1,-1,20]'

    combine -M MultiDimFit --setParameters=r_Bin0=1,r_Bin1=1,r_Bin2=1,r_Bin3=1,r_Bin4=1 -t -1 -m 125 datacard.root
    combine -M MultiDimFit --setParameters=r_Bin0=1,r_Bin1=1,r_Bin2=1,r_Bin3=1,r_Bin4=1 -t -1 -m 125 --algo=grid --points=100 -P r_Bin1 --setParameterRanges r_Bin1=0.5,1.5 --floatOtherPOIs=1 datacard.root
```

Notice that one can also perform the so called bin-by-bin unfolding (though it is strongly discouraged except for testing) with, 

```
    text2workspace.py -m 125 --X-allow-no-background -o datacard.root datacard.txt
      -P HiggsAnalysis.CombinedLimit.PhysicsModel:multiSignalModel --PO map='.*RecoBin0.*:r_Bin0[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*RecoBin1.*:r_Bin1[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*RecoBin2.*:r_Bin2[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*RecoBin3.*:r_Bin3[1,-1,20]' --PO map='.*RecoBin4.*:r_Bin4[1,-1,20]'
```

Nuisance parameters can be added to the likelihood function and profiled in the usual way via the datacards. Theory uncertainties on the inclusive cross section are typically not included in unfolded measurements.

## Regularization

The main difference with respect to other models with multiple signal contributions is the introduction of **Regularization**, which is used to stabilize the unfolding process. 

An example of unfolding in combine with and without regularization,  can be found under 
[data/tutorials/regularization](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/tree/102x/data/tutorials/regularization). 

Running `python createWs.py [-r]` will create a simple datacard and perform a fit both with and without including regularization.

The simplest way to introduce regularization in the likelihood based approach, is to apply a penalty term in the likelihood function which 
depends on the values of the truth bins (so called *Tickonov regularization*):

$$
-2\ln L = -2\ln L + P(\vec{x}) 
$$

where $P$ is a linear operator. There are two different approches which are supported to construct $P$.
If instead you run `python makeModel.py`, you will create a more complex datacard with each the two regularization scheme implemented. You will need 
to uncomment the relevant sections of code to activate SVD or TUnfold type regularization.

!!! warning
    Any unfolding method which makes use of regularization must perform studies of the potential bias/coverage properties introduced through the 
inclusion of regularization, and how strong the associated regularization is. Advice on this can be found in the CMS Statistics Committee pages. 

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

In the SVD approach - as described in the SVD paper - the penalty term is constructed directly based on the strengths ($\vec{\mu}=\{\mu_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$), 

$$
P = \tau\left| A\cdot \vec{\mu} \right|^{2},
$$

where $A$ is typically the discrete curvature matrix, with 

$$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & -1 & ... \\
1 & -2 & 1 &  ... \\
... 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Penalty terms on the derivatives can also be included. Such a penalty term is included by modifying the likelihood to include one constraint for each 
row of the product $A\cdot\vec{\mu}$, by including them as lines in the datacard of the form, 

```
    name constr formula dependents delta
```
where the regularization strength $\delta=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau}}$ and can either be a fixed value (eg by putting directly `0.01`) or as 
a modifiable parameter with eg `delta[0.01]`. 

For example, for 3 bins and a regularization strength of 0.03, the first line would be 

```
    name constr @0-2*@2+@1 r_Bin0,r_Bin1,r_Bin2 0.03
```

Alternative, valid syntaxes are  

```
    constr1 constr r_bin0-r_bin1 0.01
    constr1 constr r_bin0-r_bin1 delta[0.01]
    constr1 constr r_bin0+r_bin1 r_bin0,r_bin1 0.01
    constr1 constr r_bin0+r_bin1 {r_bin0,r_bin1} delta[0.01]
```
### TUnfold method

The Tikhonov regularization as implemented in TUnfold uses the MC information, or rather the densities prediction, as a bias vector. 
In order to give this information to Combine, a single datacard for each reco-level bin needs to be produced, so that we have access to the proper normalization terms during the minimization. In this case the bias vector is $\vec{x}_{obs}-\vec{x}_{true}$ 

Then one can write a constraint term in the datacard via (eg.)

```
    constr1 constr (r_Bin0-1.)*(shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin0__norm+shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin1__norm+shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin2__norm+shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin3__norm+shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin4__norm)+(r_Bin2-1.)*(shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin0__norm+shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin1__norm+shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin2__norm+shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin3__norm+shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin4__norm)-2*(r_Bin1-1.)*(shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin0__norm+shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin1__norm+shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin2__norm+shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin3__norm+shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin4__norm) {r_Bin0,r_Bin1,r_Bin2,shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin0__norm,shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin0__norm,shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin0__norm,shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin1__norm,shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin1__norm,shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin1__norm,shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin2__norm,shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin2__norm,shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin2__norm,shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin3__norm,shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin3__norm,shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin3__norm,shapeSig_GenBin1_RecoBin4__norm,shapeSig_GenBin0_RecoBin4__norm,shapeSig_GenBin2_RecoBin4__norm} delta[0.03]
```
