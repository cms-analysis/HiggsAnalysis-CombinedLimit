7 TeV Cross-sections for Moriond 2016 - sourced from https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LHCPhysics/LHCHXSWG/Higgs_XSBR_YR4_update.xlsx

Announced in HN: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/higgs/1738.html

- Uncertainties for QCD scale and PDF+a_s are given as relative uncertainties (in %)
- The ZH cross-section include the contribution from ggZH but ggZH is also provided separately so that a subtraction of ZH-ggZH will give the normalisation of qqZH 
- There are numbers provided separately for the cross-sections of (W+)H and (W-)H in addition to the sum of the two (these are the LAST two columns inside 13TeV-WH.txt).
- Separate numbers for PDF and alpha_S are also provided (except for bbH for which they are combined):
