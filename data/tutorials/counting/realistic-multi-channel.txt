# Counting experiment with multiple channels
# Extremely simplified version of the 35/pb H->TT analysis for mA = 90 GeV
# where shapes hardly matter as higgs has the same shape as Z->TT
# We make the following very simplificatory assumtions:
# - we consider only Z->TT and "everything else" (mostly QCD)
# - systematical uncertainties are simplified
imax 3  number of channels
jmax *  number of backgrounds ('*' = automatic)
kmax *  number of nuisance parameters (sources of systematical uncertainties)

# three channels, each with it's number of observed events 
bin          e_tau mu_tau e_mu

------------
# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in those three bins
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal
# for the signal, we normalize the yields to an hypothetical cross section of 1/pb
# so that we get an absolute limit in cross section in units of pb.
# then we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
# on each process and bin
