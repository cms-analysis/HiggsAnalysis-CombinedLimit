[flake8]
# --- These are all default flake8 ignores
# F403: ‘from module import *’ used; unable to detect undefined names
# F405: name may be undefined, or defined from star imports: module
# E402: module level import not at top of file
# W504: Raised by flake8 even when it is followed
# E203: is not PEP 8 compliant https://github.com/psf/black/issues/315
# W503: Line break occurred before a binary operator (black will do this)
# --- Leaving comment formatting alone for now
# E262: inline comment should start with '# '
# E265: block comment should start with '# '
# E266: too many leading '#' for block comment
# E501: line too long (only on comments after black run)
# ---
# E741: ambiguous variable name 'l' (too pedantic! get a good font)
# E711: sometimes needed for comparison to ROOT nullptr (better to cast to bool)
# F401: unused import (some may have side effects, need to clean by hand)
# E721: do not compare types (new, could be fixed relatively easily)
