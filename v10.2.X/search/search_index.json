We consider the search for a BSM particle \\(\\Phi\\) with a mass between 1500 and 5000 GeV, that results in an excess in the tails of an observable \\(z\\) (for example,  \\(p_{T,\\mathrm{miss}}\\)). We assume that we have found two independent discriminating features \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that can be used to construct the ABCD plane (the regions A,B,C,D will be defined by selecting regions in \\(x,y\\)), and we assume that \\(z\\) is independent of  these two features. In this way, binning the variable \\(z\\) in the same way in the regions A,B,C,D, per-bin transfer factors in the \\(z\\) variable can be derived with the ABCD method to obtain the estimate of the background in the signal region. In our example, we will generate a set of pseudodata from our background-only model, and then the background will be estimated from these data from the control regions B,C,D and compared to data in the Signal Region A.</p> <p>The tutorial has 4 main parts:</p> <ol> <li>Generate input data</li> <li>Create RooParametricHist for ABCD method</li> <li>Prepare Combine datacards</li> <li>Run fit</li> <li>Produce limits</li> </ol>"},{"location":"abcd_rooparametrichist_tutorial/rooparametrichist_exercise/#generate-input-data","title":"Generate input data","text":"<p>The histograms for the \\(z\\) observable in the different regions A,B,C,D can be produced using the <code>produce_input_histograms_and_analyse.py</code> script in <code>utils/produce_input_histograms_and_analyse.py</code>. In the script the expected rates for different signal hypotheses (as a function of the \\(\\Phi\\) mass \\(m_{\\Phi} \\in \\{1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 \\}\\) GeV) and the background yields are specified, as well as the distributions in \\(x,y,z\\) for the signals and backgrounds. In the following steps of the tutorial, we will just consider one of the mass points generated, \\(m_{\\Phi} = 1500\\) GeV, but the same analysis can be run separately on other mass points. In the \\(x-y\\) plane, the signal and the background are assumed to be normally distributed, with the background centred at \\((0,2,0.2)\\), while the signal is centred in the upper-right corner of the plane (\\(x,y&gt;0.5\\)). For the \\(z\\) feature, the background and the signal distributions are sampled from an exponential function. In the case of the signal, the tails of the exponential get enhanced as we increase the mass parameter \\(m_{\\Phi}\\). </p> <p></p> <p>The ABCD boundaries are chosen in the example to be \\((0.5,0.5)\\).

The first of these, <code>include-signal</code> has a default value of <code>0</code> but can be set to <code>1</code> as an alternative. By default, the total nominal yield and uncertainty used to test the threshold excludes signal processes. The reason for this is that typically the initial signal normalization is arbitrary, and could unduly lead to a bin being considered well-populated despite poorly populated background templates. Setting this flag will include the signal processes in the uncertainty analysis. Note that this option only affects the logic for creating a single Barlow-Beeston-lite parameter vs. separate per-process parameters - the uncertainties on all signal processes are always included in the actual model! The second flag changes the way the normalization effect of shape-altering uncertainties is handled. In the default mode (<code>1</code>) the normalization is handled separately from the shape morphing via a an asymmetric log-normal term.

To alleviate this issue, an accelerated interference modeling technique is implemented for template-based analyses via the <code>interferenceModel</code> physics model.

If \u0394x/x is the relative uncertainty in the multiplicative correction, one should put 1+\u0394x/x in the column corresponding to the process and channel. Asymmetric log-normals are instead supported by providing \u03ba<sub>down</sub>/\u03ba<sub>up</sub> where \u03ba<sub>down</sub> is the ratio of the the yield to the nominal value for a -1\u03c3 deviation of the nuisance parameter and \u03ba<sub>up</sub> is the ratio of the yield to the nominal value for a \\(+1\\sigma\\) deviation. Note that for a single-value log-normal with value \\(\\kappa=1+\\Delta x/x\\), the yield of the process it is associated with is multiplied by \\(\\kappa^{\\theta}\\). At \\(\\theta=0\\) the nominal yield is retained, at \\(\\theta=1\\sigma\\) the yield is multiplied by \\(\\kappa\\) and at \\(\\theta=-1\\sigma\\) the yield is multiplied by \\(1/\\kappa\\). This means that an uncertainty represented as <code>1.2</code> does not multiply the nominal yield by 0.8 for \\(\\theta=-1\\sigma\\); but by 0.8333. It may therefore be desirable to encode large uncertainties that have a symmetric effect on the yield as asymmetric log-normals instead. </li> <li><code>gmN</code> stands for Gamma, and is the recommended choice for the statistical uncertainty in a background determined from the number of events in a control region (or in an MC sample with limited sample size).     If the control region or simulated sample contains N events, and the extrapolation factor from the control region to the signal region is \u03b1, one shoud put N just after the <code>gmN</code> keyword, and then the value of \u03b1 in the relevant (bin,process) column.

A value of 1+\u03b5 in the column will imply that the yield of this background is allowed to float freely between x(1+\u03b5) and x/(1+\u03b5). In particular, if \u03b5 is small, this is approximately (x-\u0394x,x+\u0394x) with \u03b5=\u0394x/x.     This distribution is typically useful when you want to set a large a-priori uncertainty on a given background process, and then rely on the correlation between channels to constrain it. Note that for this use case, we usually recommend using a <code>rateParam</code> instead. If you do use <code>lnU</code>, please be aware that while Gaussian-like uncertainties behave in a similar way under profiling and marginalization, uniform uncertainties do not.

Typical examples are searches/measurements where the signal is apparent as a narrow peak over a smooth continuum background. In this context, uncertainties affecting the shapes of the signal and backgrounds can be implemented naturally as uncertainties in the parameters of those analytical functions. It is also possible to adopt an agnostic approach in which the parameters of the background model are left freely floating in the fit to the data, i.e. only requiring the background to be well described by a smooth function.</p> <p>Technically, this is implemented by means of the RooFit package, which allows writing generic probability density functions, and saving them into ROOT files.

This means that if the variation of the pdf is sizeable within the bin, there is a mismatch between the sum of the event yields per bin and the PDF normalization, which can cause a bias in the fits. More specifically, the bias is present if the contribution of the second derivative integrated in the bin size is not negligible. For linear functions, an evaluation at the bin center is correct. There are two recommended ways to work around this issue:</p> <p>1. Use narrow bins</p> <p>It is recommended to use bins that are significantly finer than the characteristic scale of the PDFs. Even in the absence of this feature, this would be advisable. Note that this caveat does not apply to analyses using templates (they are constant across each bin, so there is no bias), or using unbinned datasets.</p> <p>2. Use a RooParametricShapeBinPdf</p> <p>Another solution (currently only implemented for 1-dimensional histograms) is to use a custom PDF that performs the correct integrals internally, as in RooParametricShapeBinPdf.</p> <p>Note that this PDF class now allows parameters that are themselves RooAbsReal objects (i.e. functions of other variables).

In the narrow binned case, the two agree well, while for wide bins, accounting for the integral over the bin yields a better fit.</p> <p>You should note that using this class will result in slower fits, so you should first decide whether the added accuracy is enough to justify the reduced efficiency.</p>"},{"location":"part2/settinguptheanalysis/#beyond-simple-datacards","title":"Beyond simple datacards","text":"<p>Datacards can be extended in order to provide additional functionality and flexibility during runtime.

Let's use the realistic counting experiment datacard to test the method.</p> <p>To use the MarkovChainMC method, users need to specify this method in the command line, together with the options they want to use. For instance, to set the number of times the algorithm will run with different random seeds, use option <code>--tries</code>:</p> <pre><code>combine -M MarkovChainMC realistic-counting-experiment.txt --tries 100\n[...]\n\n -- MarkovChainMC --\nLimit: r &lt; 2.20438 +/- 0.0144695 @ 95% CL (100 tries)\nAverage chain acceptance: 0.078118\nDone in 0.14 min (cpu), 0.15 min (real)\n</code></pre> <p>Again, the resulting limit tree will contain the result. You can also save the chains using the option <code>--saveChain</code>, which will then also be included in the output file.</p> <p>Exclusion regions can be made from the posterior once an ordering principle is defined to decide how to grow the contour (there is an infinite number of possible regions that contain 68% of the posterior pdf). Below is a simple example script that can be used to plot the posterior distribution from these chains and calculate the smallest such region. Note that in this example we are ignoring the burn-in.

This can be done by using the options <code>--setParametersForFit</code> and <code>--setParametersForEval</code>, respectively. The former will set parameters before each fit, while the latter is used to set parameters after each fit, but before the NLL is evaluated. Note, of course, that if the parameter in the list is floating, it will still be floating in each fit. Therefore, it will not affect the results when using <code>--setParametersForFit</code>.</p>\n<p>A realistic example for a binned shape analysis performed in one signal region and two control samples can be found in this directory of the Combine package Datacards-shape-analysis-multiple-regions.</p>\n<p>First of all, one needs to Combine the individual datacards to build a single model, and to introduce the channel masking variables as follow:</p>\n<pre><code>combineCards.py signal_region.txt dimuon_control_region.txt singlemuon_control_region.txt &gt; combined_card.txt\ntext2workspace.py combined_card.txt --channel-masks\n</code></pre>\n<p>More information about the channel masking can be found in this\nsection Channel Masking.

This measures the compatibility between the signal+background fit and the observed data. Moreover, it can be interesting to assess the level of compatibility between the observed data in all the regions and the background prediction obtained by only fitting the control regions (CR-only fit). This can be evaluated as follow:</p>\n<pre><code>combine -M GoodnessOfFit -d combined_card.root --algo=saturated -n _result_bonly_CRonly --setParametersForFit mask_ch1=1 --setParametersForEval mask_ch1=0 --freezeParameters r --setParameters r=0\n</code></pre>\n<p>where the signal strength is frozen and the signal region is not considered in the fit (<code>--setParametersForFit mask_ch1=1</code>), but it is included in the test statistic computation (<code>--setParametersForEval mask_ch1=0</code>).

The command <code>--setParameters r=0,mask_ch1=1</code> is needed to ensure that toys are thrown using the nuisance parameters estimated from the CR-only fit to the data.

If you are computing anything else, e.g. p-values, or if your zero-prediction bins are not empty in data, you're out of luck, and you should find a way to get a reasonable background prediction there (and set an uncertainty on it, as per the point above)</li> </ul> </li> <li>How can an uncertainty be added to a zero quantity?<ul> <li>You can put an uncertainty even on a zero event yield if you use a gamma distribution. That is in fact the more proper way of doing it if the prediction of zero comes from the limited size of your MC or data sample used to compute it.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Why does changing the observation in data affect my expected limit?<ul> <li>The expected limit (if using either the default behaviour of <code>-M AsymptoticLimits</code> or using the <code>LHC-limits</code> style limit setting with toys) uses the post-fit expectation of the background model to generate toys. This means that first the model is fit to the observed data before toy generation.

These are typically the status of the last call from Minuit. For details on the meanings of these status codes see the Minuit2Minimizer documentation page.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Why does my fit not converge? <ul> <li>There are several reasons why some fits may not converge. Often some indication can be obtained from the <code>RooFitResult</code> or status that you will see information from when using the <code>--verbose X</code> (with \\(X&gt;2\\)) option. Sometimes however, it can be that the likelihood for your data is very unusual. You can get a rough idea about what the likelihood looks like as a function of your parameters (POIs and nuisances) using <code>combineTool.py -M FastScan -w myworkspace.root</code> (use --help for options, see also here.</li> <li>We have often seen that fits in Combine using <code>RooCBShape</code> as a parametric function will fail. This is related to an optimization that fails. You can try to fix the problem as described in this issue: issues#347 (i.e add the option <code>--X-rtd ADDNLL_CBNLL=0</code>).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Why does the fit/fits take so long? <ul> <li>The minimization routines are common to many methods in Combine. You can tune the fits using the generic optimization command line options described here. For example, setting the default minimizer strategy to 0 can greatly improve the speed, since this avoids running HESSE. In calculations such as <code>AsymptoticLimits</code>, HESSE is not needed and hence this can be done, however, for <code>FitDiagnostics</code> the uncertainties and correlations are part of the output, so using strategy 0 may not be particularly accurate. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Why are the results for my counting experiment so slow or unstable? <ul> <li>There is a known issue with counting experiments with large numbers of events that will cause unstable fits or even the fit to fail. You can avoid this by creating a \"fake\" shape datacard (see this section from the setting up the datacards page). The simplest way to do this is to run <code>combineCards.py -S mycountingcard.txt &gt; myshapecard.txt</code>. You may still find that your parameter uncertainties are not correct when you have large numbers of events. This can be often fixed using the <code>--robustHesse</code> option. An example of this issue is detailed here. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Why do some of my nuisance parameters have uncertainties &gt; 1?<ul> <li>When running <code>-M FitDiagnostics</code> you may find that the post-fit uncertainties of the nuisances are \\(&gt; 1\\) (or larger than their pre-fit values). If this is the case, you should first check if the same is true when adding the option <code>--minos all</code>, which will invoke MINOS to scan the likelihood as a function of these parameters to determine the crossing at \\(-2\\times\\Delta\\log\\mathcal{L}=1\\) rather than relying on the estimate from HESSE. However, this is not guaranteed to succeed, in which case you can scan the likelihood yourself using <code>MultiDimFit</code> (see here ) and specifying the option <code>--poi X</code> where <code>X</code> is your nuisance parameter. </li> </ul> </li> <li>How can I avoid using the data? <ul> <li>For almost all methods, you can use toy data (or an Asimov dataset) in place of the real data for your results to be blind. You should be careful however as in some methods, such as <code>-M AsymptoticLimits</code> or <code>-M HybridNew --LHCmode LHC-limits</code> or any other method using the option <code>--toysFrequentist</code>, the data will be used to determine the most likely nuisance parameter values (to determine the so-called a-posteriori expectation). See the section on toy data generation for details on this. </li> </ul> </li> <li>What if my nuisance parameters have correlations which are not 0 or 1?<ul> <li>Combine is designed under the assumption that each source of nuisance parameter is uncorrelated with the other sources. If you have a case where some pair (or set) of nuisances have some known correlation structure, you can compute the eigenvectors of their correlation matrix and provide these diagonalised nuisances to Combine. You can also model partial correlations, between different channels or data taking periods, of a given nuisance parameter using the <code>combineTool</code> as described in this page. </li> </ul> </li> <li>My nuisances are (artificially) constrained and/or the impact plot show some strange behaviour, especially after including MC statistical uncertainties. What can I do?<ul> <li>Depending on the details of the analysis, several solutions can be adopted to mitigate these effects. We advise to run the validation tools at first, to identify possible redundant shape uncertainties that can be safely eliminated or replaced with lnN ones. Any remaining artificial constraints should be studies. Possible mitigating strategies can be to (a) smooth the templates or (b) adopt some rebinning in order to reduce statistical fluctuations in the templates. A description of possible strategies and effects can be found in this talk by Margaret Eminizer</li> </ul> </li> <li>What do CLs, CLs+b and CLb in the code mean?<ul> <li>The names CLs+b and CLb what are found within some of the <code>RooStats</code> tools are rather outdated and should instead be referred to as p-values - \\(p_{\\mu}\\) and \\(1-p_{b}\\), respectively. We use the CLs (which itself is not a p-value) criterion often in High energy physics as it is designed to avoid excluding a signal model when the sensitivity is low (and protects against excluding due to underfluctuations in the data). Typically, when excluding a signal model the p-value \\(p_{\\mu}\\) often refers to the p-value under the signal+background hypothesis, assuming a particular value of the signal strength (\\(\\mu\\)) while \\(p_{b}\\) is the p-value under the background only hypothesis. You can find more details and definitions of the CLs criterion and \\(p_{\\mu}\\) and \\(p_{b}\\) in section 39.4.2.4 of the 2016 PDG review.       </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"part5/longexercise/","title":"Main Features of Combine (Long Exercises)","text":"<p>This exercise is designed to give a broad overview of the tools available for statistical analysis in CMS using the combine tool. Combine is a high-level tool for building <code>RooFit</code>/<code>RooStats</code> models and running common statistical methods. We will cover the typical aspects of setting up an analysis and producing the results, as well as look at ways in which we can diagnose issues and get a deeper understanding of the statistical model. This is a long exercise - expect to spend some time on it especially if you are new to Combine. If you get stuck while working through this exercise or have questions specifically about the exercise, you can ask them on this mattermost channel. Finally, we also provide some solutions to some of the questions that are asked as part of the exercise. These are available here.</p> <p>For the majority of this course we will work with a simplified version of a real analysis, that nonetheless will have many features of the full analysis. The analysis is a search for an additional heavy neutral Higgs boson decaying to tau lepton pairs. Such a signature is predicted in many extensions of the standard model, in particular the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). You can read about the analysis in the paper here. The statistical inference makes use of a variable called the total transverse mass (\\(M_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{tot}}\\)) that provides good discrimination between the resonant high-mass signal and the main backgrounds, which have a falling distribution in this high-mass region. The events selected in the analysis are split into a several categories which target the main di-tau final states as well as the two main production modes: gluon-fusion (ggH) and b-jet associated production (bbH). One example is given below for the fully-hadronic final state in the b-tag category which targets the bbH signal:</p> <p></p> <p>Initially we will start with the simplest analysis possible: a one-bin counting experiment using just the high \\(M_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{tot}}\\) region of this distribution, and from there each section of this exercise will expand on this, introducing a shape-based analysis and adding control regions to constrain the backgrounds.</p>"},{"location":"part5/longexercise/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>You can find a presentation with some more background on likelihoods and extracting confidence intervals here.

The first four lines labelled <code>bin</code>, <code>process</code>, <code>process</code> and <code>rate</code> give the channel label, the process label, a process identifier (<code>&lt;=0</code> for signal, <code>&gt;0</code> for background) and the number of expected events respectively.</li> <li>The remaining lines describe sources of systematic uncertainty. Each line gives the name of the uncertainty, (which will become the name of the nuisance parameter inside our RooFit model), the type of uncertainty (\"lnN\" = log-normal normalisation uncertainty) and the effect on each process in each channel. E.g. a 20% uncertainty on the yield is written as 1.20.</li> <li>It is also possible to add a hash symbol (<code>#</code>) at the start of a line, which Combine will then ignore when it reads the card.</li> </ul> <p>We can now run Combine directly using this datacard as input. The general format for running Combine is:</p> <pre><code>combine -M [method] [datacard] [additional options...]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"part5/longexercise/#a-computing-limits-using-the-asymptotic-approximation","title":"A: Computing limits using the asymptotic approximation","text":"<p>As we are searching for a signal process that does not exist in the standard model, it's natural to set an upper limit on the cross section times branching fraction of the process (assuming our dataset does not contain a significant discovery of new physics). Combine has dedicated methods for calculating upper limits. The most commonly used one is <code>AsymptoticLimits</code>, which implements the CLs criterion and uses the modified profile likelihood ratio for upper limits as the default test statistic. As the name implies, the test statistic distributions are determined analytically in the asymptotic approximation, so there is no need for more time-intensive toy throwing and fitting. Try running the following command:</p> <pre><code>combine -M AsymptoticLimits datacard_part1.txt -n .part1A\n</code></pre> <p>You should see the results of the observed and expected limit calculations printed to the screen. Here we have added an extra option, <code>-n .part1A</code>, which is short for <code>--name</code>, and is used to label the output file Combine produces, which in this case will be called <code>higgsCombine.part1A.AsymptoticLimits.mH120.root</code>. The file name depends on the options we ran with, and is of the form: <code>higgsCombine[name].[method].mH[mass].root</code>. The file contains a TTree called <code>limit</code> which stores the numerical values returned by the limit computation. Note that in our case we did not set a signal mass when running Combine (i.e. <code>-m 800</code>), so the output file just uses the default value of <code>120</code>. This does not affect our result in any way though, just the label that is used on the output file.</p> <p>The limits are given on a parameter called <code>r</code>. This is the default parameter of interest (POI) that is added to the model automatically. It is a linear scaling of the normalization of all signal processes given in the datacard, i.e. if \\(s_{i,j}\\) is the nominal number of signal events in channel \\(i\\) for signal process \\(j\\), then the normalization of that signal in the model is given as \\(r\\cdot s_{i,j}(\\vec{\\theta})\\), where \\(\\vec{\\theta}\\) represents the set of nuisance parameters which may also affect the signal normalization. We therefore have some choice in the interpretation of r: for the measurement of a process with a well-defined SM prediction we may enter this as the nominal yield in the datacard, such that \\(r=1\\) corresponds to this SM expectation, whereas for setting limits on BSM processes we may choose the nominal yield to correspond to some cross section, e.g. 1 pb, such that we can interpret the limit as a cross section limit directly. In this example the signal has been normalised to a cross section times branching fraction of 1 fb.</p> <p>The expected limit is given under the background-only hypothesis. The median value under this hypothesis as well as the quantiles needed to give the 68% and 95% intervals are also calculated. These are all the ingredients needed to produce the standard limit plots you will see in many CMS results, for example the \\(\\sigma \\times \\mathcal{B}\\) limits for the \\(\\text{bb}\\phi\\rightarrow\\tau\\tau\\) process:</p> <p></p> <p>In this case we only computed the values for one signal mass hypothesis, indicated by a red dashed line.</p> <p>Tasks and questions:</p> <ul> <li>There are some important uncertainties missing from the datacard above. Add the uncertainty on the luminosity (name: <code>lumi_13TeV</code>) which has a 2.5% effect on all processes (except the <code>jetFakes</code>, which are taken from data), and uncertainties on the inclusive cross sections of the <code>Ztautau</code> and <code>ttbar</code> processes (with names <code>xsec_Ztautau</code> and <code>xsec_ttbar</code>) which are 4% and 6% respectively.</li> <li>Try changing the values of some uncertainties (up or down, or removing them altogether) - how do the expected and observed limits change?</li> <li>Now try changing the number of observed events. The observed limit will naturally change, but the expected does too - why might this be?</li> </ul> <p>There are other command line options we can supply to Combine which will change its behaviour when run. You can see the full set of supported options by doing <code>combine -h</code>. Many options are specific to a given method, but others are more general and are applicable to all methods. Throughout this tutorial we will highlight some of the most useful options you may need to use, for example:</p> <ul> <li>The range on the signal strength modifier: <code>--rMin=X</code> and <code>--rMax=Y</code>: In <code>RooFit</code> parameters can optionally have a range specified. The implication of this is that their values cannot be adjusted beyond the limits of this range. The min and max values can be adjusted though, and we might need to do this for our POI <code>r</code> if the order of magnitude of our measurement is different from the default range of <code>[0, 20]</code>. This will be discussed again later in the tutorial.</li> <li>Verbosity: <code>-v X</code>: By default combine does not usually produce much output on the screen other the main result at the end. However, much more detailed information can be printed by setting the <code>-v N</code> with N larger than zero. For example at <code>-v 3</code> the logs from the minimizer, Minuit, will also be printed. These are very useful for debugging problems with the fit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"part5/longexercise/#advanced-section-b-computing-limits-with-toys","title":"Advanced section: B: Computing limits with toys","text":"<p>Now we will look at computing limits without the asymptotic approximation, so instead using toy datasets to determine the test statistic distributions under the signal+background and background-only hypotheses. This can be necessary if we are searching for signal in bins with a small number of events expected. In Combine we will use the <code>HybridNew</code> method to calculate limits using toys. This mode is capable of calculating limits with several different test statistics and with fine-grained control over how the toy datasets are generated internally. To calculate LHC-style profile likelihood limits (i.e. the same as we did with the asymptotic) we set the option <code>--LHCmode LHC-limits</code>.

There will not be much output to the screen while combine is running. You can add the option <code>-v 1</code> to get a better idea of what is going on. You should see Combine stepping around in <code>r</code>, trying to find the value for which CLs = 0.05, i.e. the 95% CL limit. The <code>--saveHybridResult</code> option will cause the test statistic distributions that are generated at each tested value of <code>r</code> to be saved in the output ROOT file.</p> <p>To get an expected limit add the option <code>--expectedFromGrid X</code>, where <code>X</code> is the desired quantile, e.g. for the median:</p> <pre><code>combine -M HybridNew datacard_part1.txt --LHCmode LHC-limits -n .part1B --saveHybridResult --expectedFromGrid 0.500\n</code></pre> <p>Calculate the median expected limit and the 68% range.

In a typical analysis we will produce TH1 histograms of some variable sensitive to the presence of signal: one for the data and one for each signal and background processes. Then we add a few extra lines to the datacard to link the declared processes to these shapes which are saved in a ROOT file, for example:</p> Show datacard <pre><code>imax 1\njmax 1\nkmax *\n---------------\nshapes * * simple-shapes-TH1_input.root $PROCESS $PROCESS_$SYSTEMATIC\nshapes signal * simple-shapes-TH1_input.root $PROCESS$MASS $PROCESS$MASS_$SYSTEMATIC\n---------------\nbin bin1\nobservation 85\n------------------------------\nbin             bin1       bin1\nprocess         signal     background\nprocess         0          1\nrate            10         100\n--------------------------------\nlumi     lnN    1.10       1.0\nbgnorm   lnN    1.00       1.3\nalpha  shape    -          1\n</code></pre> <p>Note that as with the one-bin card, the total nominal rate of a given process must be specified in the <code>rate</code> line of the datacard. This should agree with the value returned by <code>TH1::Integral</code>. However, we can also put a value of <code>-1</code> and the Integral value will be substituted automatically.</p> <p>There are two other differences with respect to the one-bin card:</p> <ul> <li>A new block of lines at the top defining how channels and processes are mapped to the histograms (more than one line can be used)</li> <li>In the list of systematic uncertainties some are marked as shape instead of lnN</li> </ul> <p>The syntax of the \"shapes\" line is: <code>shapes [process] [channel] [file] [histogram] [histogram_with_systematics]</code>. It is possible to use the <code>*</code> wildcard to map multiple processes and/or channels with one line. The histogram entries can contain the <code>$PROCESS</code>, <code>$CHANNEL</code> and <code>$MASS</code> place-holders which will be substituted when searching for a given (process, channel) combination. The value of <code>$MASS</code> is specified by the <code>-m</code> argument when combine. By default the observed data process name will be <code>data_obs</code>.</p> <p>Shape uncertainties can be added by supplying two additional histograms for a process, corresponding to the distribution obtained by shifting that parameter up and down by one standard deviation. These shapes will be interpolated (see the template shape uncertainties section for details) for shifts within \\(\\pm1\\sigma\\) and linearly extrapolated beyond. The normalizations are interpolated linearly in log scale just like we do for log-normal uncertainties.</p> <p></p> <p>The final argument of the \"shapes\" line above should contain the <code>$SYSTEMATIC</code> place-holder which will be substituted by the systematic name given in the datacard.</p> <p>In the list of uncertainties the interpretation of the values for <code>shape</code> lines is a bit different from <code>lnN</code>. The effect can be \"-\" or 0 for no effect, 1 for normal effect, and possibly something different from 1 to test larger or smaller effects (in that case, the unit Gaussian is scaled by that factor before using it as parameter for the interpolation).</p> <p>In this section we will use a datacard corresponding to the full distribution that was shown at the start of section 1, not just the high mass region. Have a look at <code>datacard_part2.txt</code>: this is still currently a one-bin counting experiment, however the yields are much higher since we now consider the full range of \\(M_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{tot}}\\). If you run the asymptotic limit calculation on this you should find the sensitivity is significantly worse than before.</p> <p>The first task is to convert this to a shape analysis: the file <code>datacard_part2.shapes.root</code> contains all the necessary histograms, including those for the relevant shape systematic uncertainties. Add the relevant <code>shapes</code> lines to the top of the datacard (after the <code>kmax</code> line) to map the processes to the correct TH1s in this file. Hint: you will need a different line for the signal process.</p> <p>Compared to the counting experiment we must also consider the effect of uncertainties that change the shape of the distribution. Some, like <code>CMS_eff_t_highpt</code>, were present before, as it has both a shape and normalisation effect. Others are primarily shape effects so were not included before.</p> <p>Add the following shape uncertainties: <code>top_pt_ttbar_shape</code> affecting <code>ttbar</code>,the tau energy scale uncertainties <code>CMS_scale_t_1prong0pi0_13TeV</code>, <code>CMS_scale_t_1prong1pi0_13TeV</code> and <code>CMS_scale_t_3prong0pi0_13TeV</code> affecting all processes except <code>jetFakes</code>, and <code>CMS_eff_t_highpt</code> also affecting the same processes.</p> <p>Once this is done you can run the asymptotic limit calculation on this datacard. From now on we will convert the text datacard into a RooFit workspace ourselves instead of combine doing it internally every time we run. This is a good idea for more complex analyses since the conversion step can take a notable amount of time. For this we use the <code>text2workspace.py</code> command:</p> <p><pre><code>text2workspace.py datacard_part2.txt -m 800 -o workspace_part2.root\n</code></pre> And then we can use this as input to combine instead of the text datacard: <pre><code>combine -M AsymptoticLimits workspace_part2.root -m 800\n</code></pre> Tasks and questions:</p> <ul> <li>Verify that the sensitivity of the shape analysis is indeed improved over the counting analysis in the first part.</li> <li>Advanced task: You can open the workspace ROOT file interactively and print the contents: <code>w-&gt;Print();</code>. Each process is represented by a PDF object that depends on the shape morphing nuisance parameters. From the workspace, choose a process and shape uncertainty, and make a plot overlaying the nominal shape with different values of the shape morphing nuisance parameter. You can change the value of a parameter with <code>w-&gt;var(\"X\")-&gt;setVal(Y)</code>, and access a particular pdf with <code>w-&gt;pdf(\"Z\")</code>. PDF objects in RooFit have a createHistogram method that requires the name of the observable (the variable defining the x-axis) - this is called <code>CMS_th1x</code> in combine datacards.

Our estimates of the backgrounds come either from MC simulation or from sideband regions in data, and in both cases these estimates are subject to a statistical uncertainty on the number of simulated or data events. In principle we should include an independent statistical uncertainty for every bin of every process in our model. It's important to note that Combine/<code>RooFit</code> does not take this into account automatically - statistical fluctuations of the data are implicitly accounted for in the likelihood formalism, but statistical uncertainties in the model must be specified by us.</p> <p>One way to implement these uncertainties is to create a <code>shape</code> uncertainty for each bin of each process, in which the up and down histograms have the contents of the bin  shifted up and down by the \\(1\\sigma\\) uncertainty. However this makes the likelihood evaluation computationally inefficient, and can lead to a large number of nuisance parameters in more complex models. Instead we will use a feature in Combine called <code>autoMCStats</code> that creates these automatically from the datacard, and uses a technique called \"Barlow-Beeston-lite\" to reduce the number of systematic uncertainties that are created. This works on the assumption that for high MC event counts we can model the uncertainty with a Gaussian distribution. Given the uncertainties in different bins are independent, the total uncertainty of several processes in a particular bin is just the sum of \\(N\\) individual Gaussians, which is itself a Gaussian distribution. So instead of \\(N\\) nuisance parameters we need only one. This breaks down when the number of events is small and we are not in the Gaussian regime. The <code>autoMCStats</code> tool has a threshold setting on the number of events below which the the Barlow-Beeston-lite approach is not used, and instead a Poisson PDF is used to model per-process uncertainties in that bin.</p> <p>After reading the full documentation on <code>autoMCStats</code> here, add the corresponding line to your datacard. Start by setting a threshold of 0, i.e. <code>[channel] autoMCStats 0</code>, to force the use of Barlow-Beeston-lite in all bins.</p> <p>Tasks and questions:</p> <ul> <li>Check how much the cross section measurement and uncertainties change using <code>FitDiagnostics</code>.</li> <li>It is also useful to check how the expected uncertainty changes using an Asimov dataset, say with <code>r=10</code> injected.</li> <li>Advanced task: See what happens if the Poisson threshold is increased.

This can take many forms, but a common approach is to use \"control regions\" (CRs) that are pure and/or have higher statistics for a given process. These are defined by event selections that are similar to, but non-overlapping with, the signal region. In our \\(\\phi\\rightarrow\\tau\\tau\\) example the \\(\\text{Z}\\rightarrow\\tau\\tau\\) background normalisation can be calibrated using a \\(\\text{Z}\\rightarrow\\mu\\mu\\) CR, and the \\(\\text{t}\\bar{\\text{t}}\\) background using an \\(e+\\mu\\) CR. By comparing the number of data events in these CRs to our MC expectation we can obtain scale factors to apply to the corresponding backgrounds in the signal region (SR). The idea is that the data will gives us a more accurate prediction of the background with less systematic uncertainties. For example, we can remove the cross section and acceptance uncertainties in the SR, since we are no longer using the MC prediction (with a caveat discussed below). While we could simply derive these correction factors and apply them to our signal region datacard and better way is to include these regions in our fit model and tie the normalisations of the backgrounds in the CR and SR together. This has a number of advantages:</p> <ul> <li>Automatically handles the statistical uncertainty due to the number of data events in the CR</li> <li>Allows for the presence of some signal contamination in the CR to be handled correctly</li> <li>The CRs are typically not 100% pure in the background they're meant to control - other backgrounds may be present, with their own systematic uncertainties, some of which may be correlated with the SR or other CRs. Propagating these effects through to the SR \"by hand\" can become very challenging.</li> </ul> <p>In this section we will continue to use the same SR as in the previous one, however we will switch to a lower signal mass hypothesis, \\(m_{\\phi}=200\\)GeV, as its sensitivity depends more strongly on the background prediction than the high mass signal, so is better for illustrating the use of CRs.

The cross section and acceptance uncertainties for these processes have pre-emptively been removed from the SR card. However we cannot get away with neglecting acceptance effects altogether. We are still implicitly using the MC simulation to predict to the ratio of events in the CR and SR, and this ratio will in general carry a theoretical acceptance uncertainty. If the CRs are well chosen then this uncertainty should be smaller than the direct acceptance uncertainty in the SR however. The uncertainties <code>acceptance_ttbar_cr</code> and <code>acceptance_DY_cr</code> have been added to these datacards cover this effect.

There are a number of ways that parameter uncertainties are estimated in combine, and some are more precise than others:</p> <ul> <li>Covariance matrix: calculated by the Minuit HESSE routine, this gives a symmetric uncertainty by definition and is only accurate when the profile likelihood for this parameter is symmetric and parabolic.</li> <li>Minos error: calculated by the Minuit MINOS route - performs a search for the upper and lower values of the parameter that give the critical value of \\(q\\) for the desired CL. Return an asymmetric interval. This is what <code>FitDiagnostics</code> does by default, but only for the parameter of interest. Usually accurate but prone to fail on more complex models and not easy to control the tolerance for terminating the search.</li> <li>RobustFit error: a custom implementation in combine similar to Minos that returns an asymmetric interval, but with more control over the precision. Enabled by adding <code>--robustFit 1</code> when running <code>FitDiagnostics</code>.</li> <li>Explicit scan of the profile likelihood on a chosen grid of parameter values. Interpolation between points to find parameter values corresponding to appropriate d. It is a good idea to use this for important measurements since we can see by eye that there are no unexpected features in the shape of the likelihood curve.</li> </ul> <p>In this section we will look at the last approach, using the <code>MultiDimFit</code> mode of combine. By default this mode just performs a single fit to the data:</p> <pre><code>combine -M MultiDimFit workspace_part3.root -n .part3E -m 200 --rMin -1 --rMax 2\n</code></pre> <p>You should see the best-fit value of the signal strength reported and nothing else. By adding the <code>--algo X</code> option combine will run an additional algorithm after this best fit. Here we will use <code>--algo grid</code>, which performs a scan of the likelihood with <code>r</code> fixed to a set of different values. The set of points will be equally spaced between the <code>--rMin</code> and <code>--rMax</code> values, and the number of points is controlled with <code>--points N</code>:</p> <pre><code>combine -M MultiDimFit workspace_part3.root -n .part3E -m 200 --rMin -1 --rMax 2 --algo grid --points 30\n</code></pre> <p>The results of the scan are written into the output file, if opened interactively should see:</p> Show output <pre><code>root [1] limit-&gt;Scan(\"r:deltaNLL\")\n************************************\n*    Row   *         r *  deltaNLL *\n************************************\n*        0 * 0.5399457 *         0 *\n*        1 * -0.949999 * 5.6350698 *\n*        2 * -0.850000 * 4.9482779 *\n*        3 *     -0.75 * 4.2942519 *\n*        4 * -0.649999 * 3.6765284 *\n*        5 * -0.550000 * 3.0985388 *\n*        6 * -0.449999 * 2.5635135 *\n*        7 * -0.349999 * 2.0743820 *\n*        8 *     -0.25 * 1.6337506 *\n*        9 * -0.150000 * 1.2438088 *\n*       10 * -0.050000 * 0.9059833 *\n*       11 * 0.0500000 * 0.6215767 *\n*       12 * 0.1500000 * 0.3910581 *\n*       13 *      0.25 * 0.2144184 *\n*       14 * 0.3499999 * 0.0911308 *\n*       15 * 0.4499999 * 0.0201983 *\n*       16 * 0.5500000 * 0.0002447 *\n*       17 * 0.6499999 * 0.0294311 *\n*       18 *      0.75 * 0.1058298 *\n*       19 * 0.8500000 * 0.2272539 *\n*       20 * 0.9499999 * 0.3912534 *\n*       21 * 1.0499999 * 0.5952836 *\n*       22 * 1.1499999 * 0.8371513 *\n*       23 *      1.25 * 1.1142146 *\n*       24 * 1.3500000 * 1.4240909 *\n*       25 * 1.4500000 * 1.7644306 *\n*       26 * 1.5499999 * 2.1329684 *\n*       27 * 1.6499999 * 2.5273966 *\n*       28 *      1.75 * 2.9458723 *\n*       29 * 1.8500000 * 3.3863399 *\n*       30 * 1.9500000 * 3.8469560 *\n************************************\n</code></pre> <p>To turn this into a plot run: <pre><code>python plot1DScan.py higgsCombine.part3E.MultiDimFit.mH200.root -o single_scan\n</code></pre> This script will also perform a spline interpolation of the points to give accurate values for the uncertainties.</p> <p>In the next step we will split this total uncertainty into two components. It is typical to separate the contribution from statistics and systematics, and sometimes even split the systematic part into different components. This gives us an idea of which aspects of the uncertainty dominate. The statistical component is usually defined as the uncertainty we would have if all the systematic uncertainties went to zero. We can emulate this effect by freezing all the nuisance parameters when we do the scan in <code>r</code>, such that they do not vary in the fit. This is achieved by adding the <code>--freezeParameters allConstrainedNuisances</code> option. It would also work if the parameters are specified explicitly, e.g. <code>--freezeParameters CMS_eff_t,lumi_13TeV,...,</code> but the <code>allConstrainedNuisances</code> option is more concise. Run the scan again with the systematics frozen, and use the plotting script to overlay this curve with the previous one:</p> <pre><code>combine -M MultiDimFit workspace_part3.root -n .part3E.freezeAll -m 200 --rMin -1 --rMax 2 --algo grid --points 30 --freezeParameters allConstrainedNuisances\npython plot1DScan.py higgsCombine.part3E.MultiDimFit.mH200.root --others 'higgsCombine.part3E.freezeAll.MultiDimFit.mH200.root:FreezeAll:2' -o freeze_first_attempt\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>This doesn't look quite right - the best-fit has been shifted because unfortunately the <code>--freezeParameters</code> option acts before the initial fit, whereas we only want to add it for the scan after this fit. To remedy this we can use a feature of Combine that lets us save a \"snapshot\" of the best-fit parameter values, and reuse this snapshot in subsequent fits. First we perform a single fit, adding the <code>--saveWorkspace</code> option:</p> <p><pre><code>combine -M MultiDimFit workspace_part3.root -n .part3E.snapshot -m 200 --rMin -1 --rMax 2 --saveWorkspace\n</code></pre> The output file will now contain a copy of our workspace from the input, and this copy will contain a snapshot of the best-fit parameter values. We can now run the frozen scan again, but instead using this copy of the workspace as input, and restoring the snapshot that was saved:</p> <pre><code>combine -M MultiDimFit higgsCombine.part3E.snapshot.MultiDimFit.mH200.root -n .part3E.freezeAll -m 200 --rMin -1 --rMax 2 --algo grid --points 30 --freezeParameters allConstrainedNuisances --snapshotName MultiDimFit\npython plot1DScan.py higgsCombine.part3E.MultiDimFit.mH200.root --others 'higgsCombine.part3E.freezeAll.MultiDimFit.mH200.root:FreezeAll:2' -o freeze_second_attempt --breakdown Syst,Stat\n</code></pre> <p>Now the plot should look correct:</p> <p></p> <p>We added the <code>--breakdown Syst,Stat</code> option to the plotting script to make it calculate the systematic component, which is defined simply as \\(\\sigma_{\\text{syst}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{\\text{tot}} - \\sigma^2_{\\text{stat}}}\\). To split the systematic uncertainty into different components we just need to run another scan with a subset of the systematics frozen. For example, say we want to split this into experimental and theoretical uncertainties, we would calculate the uncertainties as:</p> <p>\\(\\sigma_{\\text{theory}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{\\text{tot}} - \\sigma^2_{\\text{fr.theory}}}\\)</p> <p>\\(\\sigma_{\\text{expt}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{\\text{fr.theory}} - \\sigma^2_{\\text{fr.theory+expt}}}\\)</p> <p>\\(\\sigma_{\\text{stat}} = \\sigma_{\\text{fr.theory+expt}}\\)</p> <p>where fr.=freeze.</p> <p>While it is perfectly fine to just list the relevant nuisance parameters in the <code>--freezeParameters</code> argument for the \\(\\sigma_{\\text{fr.theory}}\\) scan, a convenient way can be to define a named group of parameters in the text datacard and then freeze all parameters in this group with <code>--freezeNuisanceGroups</code>. The syntax for defining a group is:</p> <pre><code>[group name] group = uncertainty_1 uncertainty_2 ... uncertainty_N\n</code></pre> <p>Tasks and questions:</p> <ul> <li>Take our stat+syst split one step further and separate the systematic part into two: one part for hadronic tau uncertainties and one for all others.</li> <li>Do this by defining a <code>tauID</code> group in the datacard including the following parameters: <code>CMS_eff_t</code>, <code>CMS_eff_t_highpt</code>, and the three <code>CMS_scale_t_X</code> uncertainties.</li> <li>To plot this and calculate the split via the relations above you can just add further arguments to the <code>--others</code> option in the <code>plot1DScan.py</code> script. Each is of the form: <code>'[file]:[label]:[color]'</code>. The <code>--breakdown</code> argument should also be extended to three terms.</li> <li>How important are these tau-related uncertainties compared to the others?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"part5/longexercise/#f-use-of-channel-masking","title":"F: Use of channel masking","text":"<p>We will now return briefly to the topic of blinding. We've seen that we can compute expected results by performing any Combine method on an Asimov dataset generated using <code>-t -1</code>. This is useful, because we can optimise our analysis without introducing any accidental bias that might come from looking at the data in the signal region. However our control regions have been chosen specifically to be signal-free, and it would be useful to use the data here to set the normalisation of our backgrounds even while the signal region remains blinded. Unfortunately there's no easy way to generate a partial Asimov dataset just for the signal region, but instead we can use a feature called \"channel masking\" to remove specific channels from the likelihood evaluation. One useful application of this feature is to make post-fit plots of the signal region from a control-region-only fit.</p> <p>To use the masking we first need to rerun <code>text2workspace.py</code> with an extra option that will create variables named like <code>mask_[channel]</code> in the workspace:</p> <pre><code>text2workspace.py part3_combined.txt -m 200 -o workspace_part3_with_masks.root --channel-masks\n</code></pre> <p>These parameters have a default value of 0 which means the channel is not masked.

For our data, the probability to observe an event with a value in an interval bounded by a and b is given by,</p> \\[ P\\left(m~\\epsilon~[a,b] \\right) = \\int_{a}^{b} f(m|\\alpha)dm  \\] <p>As that interval shrinks we can say this probability just becomes equal to \\(f(m|\\alpha)dm\\).</p> <p>The probability to observe the dataset we have is given by the product of such probabilities for each of our data points, so that </p> \\[\\mathcal{L}(\\alpha) \\propto \\prod_{i} f(m_{i}|\\alpha)\\] <p>Note that for a specific dataset, the \\(dm\\) factors which should be there are constnant. They can therefore be absorbed into the constant of proportionality!</p> <p>The maximum likelihood esitmator for \\(\\alpha\\), usually written as \\(\\hat{\\alpha}\\), is found by maximising \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\alpha)\\).</p> <p>Note that this will not depend on the value of the constant of proportionality so we can ignore it. This is true in most scenarios because usually only the ratio of likelihoods is needed, in which the constant factors out. </p> <p>Obviously this multiplication of exponentials can lead to very large (or very small) numbers which can lead to numerical instabilities. To avoid this, we can take logs of the likelihood.

Make sure to do <code>import ROOT</code> at the top of your script</p> <p>We have seen how to create variables and PDFs, and how to fit a PDF to data. But what if we have a counting experiment, or a histogram template shape? And what about systematic uncertainties?  We are going to build a likelihood  for this:</p> <p>\\(\\mathcal{L} \\propto p(\\text{data}|\\text{parameters})\\)</p> <p>where our parameters are parameters of interest, \\(\\mu\\), and nuisance parameters, \\(\\nu\\). The nuisance parameters are constrained by external measurements, so we add constraint terms \\(\\pi(\\vec{\\nu}_0|\\vec{\\nu})\\)</p> <p>So we have \\(\\mathcal{L} \\propto p(\\text{data}|\\mu,\\vec{\\nu})\\cdot \\pi(\\vec{\\nu}_0|\\vec{\\nu})\\)</p> <p>now we will try to build the likelihood by hand for a 1-bin counting experiment. The data is the number of observed events \\(N\\), and the probability is just a Poisson probability \\(p(N|\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^N e^{-\\lambda}}{N!}\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the number of events expected in our signal+background model: \\(\\lambda = \\mu\\cdot s(\\vec{\\nu}) + b(\\vec{\\nu})\\). </p> <p>In the expression, s and b are the numbers of expected signal and background events, which both depend on the nuisance parameters. We will start by building a simple likelihood function with one signal process and one background process. We will assume there are no nuisance parameters for now. The number of observed events in data is 15, the expected number of signal events is 5 and the expected number of background events 8.1.</p> <p>It is easiest to use the <code>RooFit</code> workspace factory to build our model (this tutorial has more information on the factory syntax).</p> <p><pre><code>import ROOT\nw = ROOT.RooWorkspace(\"w\")\n</code></pre> We need to create an expression for the number of events in our model, \\(\\mu s +b\\):</p> <p><pre><code>w.factory('expr::n(\"mu*s +b\", mu[1.0,0,4], s[5],b[8.1])')\n</code></pre> Now we can build the likelihood, which is just our Poisson PDF: <pre><code>w.factory('Poisson::poisN(N[15],n)')\n</code></pre></p> <p>To find the best fit value for our parameter of interest \\(\\mu\\) we need to maximize the likelihood. In practice it is actually easier to minimize the Negative log of the likelihood, or NLL:</p> <pre><code>w.factory('expr::NLL(\"-log(@0)\",poisN)')\n</code></pre> <p>We can now use the <code>RooMinimizer</code> to find the minimum of the NLL</p> <p><pre><code>nll = w.function(\"NLL\")\nminim = ROOT.RooMinimizer(nll)\nminim.setErrorLevel(0.5)\nminim.minimize(\"Minuit2\",\"migrad\")\nbestfitnll = nll.getVal()\n</code></pre> Notice that we need to set the error level to 0.5 to get the uncertainties (relying on Wilks' theorem!) - note that there is a more reliable way of extracting the confidence interval (explicitly rather than relying on migrad). We will discuss this a bit later in this section.</p> <p>Now we will add a nuisance parameter, lumi, which represents the luminosity uncertainty. It has a 2.5% effect on both the signal and the background. The parameter will be log-normally distributed: when it's 0, the normalization of the signal and background are not modified; at \\(+1\\sigma\\) the signal and background normalizations will be multiplied by 1.025 and at \\(-1\\sigma\\) they will be divided by 1.025.  We should modify the expression for the number of events in our model:</p> <pre><code>w.factory('expr::n(\"mu*s*pow(1.025,lumi) +b*pow(1.025,lumi)\", mu[1.0,0,4], s[5],b[8.1],lumi[0,-4,4])')\n</code></pre> <p>And we add a unit gaussian constraint  <pre><code>w.factory('Gaussian::lumiconstr(lumi,0,1)')\n</code></pre></p> <p>Our full likelihood will now be <pre><code>w.factory('PROD::likelihood(poisN,lumiconstr)')\n</code></pre> and the NLL <pre><code>w.factory('expr::NLL(\"-log(@0)\",likelihood)')\n</code></pre></p> <p>Which we can minimize in the same way as before. </p> <p>Now we will extend our model a bit. </p> <ul> <li>Expanding on what was demonstrated above, build the likelihood for \\(N=15\\), a signal process s with expectation 5 events, a background ztt with expectation 3.7 events and a background tt with expectation 4.4 events. The luminosity uncertainty applies to all three processes. The signal process is further subject to a 5% log-normally distributed uncertainty sigth, tt is subject to a 6% log-normally distributed uncertainty ttxs, and ztt is subject to a 4% log-normally distributed uncertainty zttxs. Find the best-fit value and the associated uncertainty</li> <li>Also perform an explicit scan of the \\(\\Delta\\) NLL ( = log of profile likelihood ratio) and make a graph of the scan. Some example code can be found below to get you started. Hint: you'll need to perform fits for different values of mu, where mu is fixed. In <code>RooFit</code> you can set a variable to be constant as <code>var(\"VARNAME\").setConstant(True)</code></li> <li>From the curve that you have created by performing an explicit scan, we can extract the 68% CL interval.

Finally \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is the integrated luminosity.</p> <p>In this example, the ggH MC events are normalised before any selection is performed to \\(\\sigma_{ggH} \\cdot \\mathcal{B}^{\\gamma\\gamma}\\), taking the values from the LHCHWG twiki. Note this does not include the lumi scaling, which may be different to what you have in your own analyses! We can then calculate the efficiency factor, \\(\\epsilon\\), by taking the sum of weights in the MC dataset and dividing through by \\(\\sigma_{ggH} \\cdot \\mathcal{B}^{\\gamma\\gamma}\\).

It also allows us to apply the discrete profiling method in our analysis. In this method, the index labelling which pdf is active (a discrete nuisance parameter) is left floating in the fit, and will be profiled by looping through all the possible index values and finding the pdf which gives the best fit. In this manner, we are able to account for the uncertainty in the choice of the background function.</p> <p>Note, by default, the multipdf will tell combine to add 0.5 to the NLL for each parameter in the pdf.

This provides extra discrimination power to separate the signal from background and improve the measurement.</p> <p>As you will find, the datacards also contain several background processes. To control them properly we will also add regions enriched in the respective backgrounds.
